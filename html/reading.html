            <p>To choose the right career is probably the most important decision in anyone’s life. But most of the people are a victim of career indecisiveness. 
                A career guidance platform is the need of the hour to cater to millions of confused individuals. It’s weird that when we buy some product online or
                 go shopping, or if we are going to check out some new place we always consult our friends. But when it comes to career guidance, we are happy with
                  whatever life has for us in-store rather than seeking career guidance and finding the most suitable career path. There is a high probability if you
                   don’t seek career guidance at the right time you might end up in the wrong career. <br></p>

                   <li>How will you feel if your friends are living their life to fullest and going on trips once in 3 months?</li>
                   <li>How will you feel if daily you see the status updates of your friends/ relatives getting a promotion or going out for a team outing?</li>
                
                 The need of the hour is to look for alternatives which not only gives you a satisfying career but also a happy life. So don’t just sit there
                     and wait for some magic to happen in your career life. You need to ponder and the best recourse is to go for career counselling at the nick of 
                     time before it is too late. Now the main question which arises here is that how to choose the right career guidance platform. <br>
